# Sleep-Apnea-Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can detect sleep apnea, a common and serious sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or shallow breaths during sleep. The project involves leveraging physiological signals, such as ECG (Electrocardiogram), SpO2 (oxygen saturation), or EEG (brain activity), to identify apnea events.
